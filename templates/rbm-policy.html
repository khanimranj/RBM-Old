                    <p class="margin-top-25 margin-left-35">Opt-in is the process of getting consent from Users before sending them messages.</p>
                    <p class="margin-top-25 margin-left-35">When submitting an agent for verification, the Developers must provide information indicating how the business gets the opt-in from the End Users.

                    <p class="margin-top-20 margin-left-35">All agents must comply with an End User’s request to opt-out (e.g., by sending “STOP” message or equivalent in Agent’s language) and be able to promptly process and adhere to the End Users’ request to opt-out. Developers must implement an opt out functionality in the Agent. This should be explicitly shown in the Agent’s flow. Once the user selects opt-out he should not receive any further A2P messages from the Agent.</p>
                    <p class="margin-top-20 margin-left-35">The keyword used for Opt-out is to be provided by Developers as part of the verification process. “STOP” and any additional keywords supported for Opt-out should be included when submitting the Agent for verification. </p>
                    <p class="margin-top-20 margin-left-35">The VinCam-RBM team platform also provides help for implementing Stop. The default keyword to opt-out is STOP. The default keyword to cancel the opt-out is START.</p>
                    <h4 class="margin-top-30 margin-left-35 font-size-16"><strong>8.3 P2A Response Functionality</strong></h4>
                    <p class="margin-top-20 margin-left-35">It is recommended that Developers implement functionality to respond to P2A messages from End Users, wherein the Agent responds to certain keywords, e.g., HI, START, MENU, HELP. Responding to P2A messages is optional. If a response to P2A messages is supported, a response to the keyword “HI” is required. Support for other keywords is optional.</p>
                    <h4 class="margin-top-30 margin-left-35 font-size-16"><strong>8.4 Other Functionality</strong></h4>
                    <p class="margin-top-20 margin-left-35">Developers should also implement standard commands like RESTART and HELP/MENU. Agents should support restarting of conversations by welcoming the End User with an initial message that lists the standard commands and options End Users can choose to take the conversation forward. These are optional.</p>

                        <li class="margin-top-15">Ensure that you only communicate with users who have explicitly opted into receiving your messages. If the user has opted in to receive SMS messages, it also counts as an opt-in for RCS.</li>
                        <li class="margin-top-15">Do not send unsolicited content, or aggressively message users.</li>

                    <p class="margin-left-35 margin-top-15">Do not misuse RBM. We want RBM to be useful, relevant, and safe for users, thus we do not allow the following:</p>

                        <li class="margin-top-15">Phishing scams</li>

                    <h4 class="margin-top-30 margin-left-35 font-size-16"><strong>10.4 Misrepresentation and Impersonation </strong></h4>
                    <p class="margin-left-35 margin-top-15">Users should not feel misled by RBM content, and that means Agents should be upfront, honest, and provide them with the information that they need to make informed decisions. RBM content must not represent you or your products or services in a way that is not accurate, realistic, and truthful. For example, the Agents must not:</p>
                    <ul class="margin-left-35">
                        <li class="margin-top-15">Be misleading (e.g., making false statement about the business or qualification, falsely affiliating with other individuals, organizations, products, and services, or making false claims which position improbable results as likely outcomes even if they are technically feasible).</li>
                        <li class="margin-top-15">Conceal or misstate information about the business, product, or service (e.g., using a false or fictitious identity, business name or contact information, offers for products or services that are normally offered for free).</li>
                        <li class="margin-top-15">Contain information which is not clearly relevant to the actual product or service of the Agent.</li>
                        <li class="margin-top-15">Fail to disclose the payment model and full expense that a user will bear (e.g., shipping costs and other billing related information, recurring subscription costs).</li>
                        <li class="margin-top-15">Prompt users to initiate a purchase, download, or other commitment without first providing all relevant information and obtaining the user’s explicit consent.</li>
                        <li class="margin-top-15">Feature content that is provably false and could significantly undermine participation or trust in civic, electoral, or democratic processes such as census participation or public voting procedures.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="margin-top-30 margin-left-35 font-size-16"><strong>10.5 Profanity and inappropriate language </strong></h4>
                    <p class="margin-left-35 margin-top-15">Don’t use obscene, profane, or offensive language, or nonsensical content that carries no actual meaning.</p>

                    <h4 class="margin-top-30 margin-left-35 font-size-16"><strong>12.1 Pre-Launch - Agent Submission Rejection</strong></h4>
                    <p class="margin-left-35 margin-top-15">VinCam-RBM team verifies all Agent details when the developer submits agents for launch. The request for launch is rejected if the Agent violates any of the requirements and the Developer is notified over email.</p>
                    <p class="margin-left-35 margin-top-15">Developers can resubmit the Agent for launch once the problem is fixed.</p>
                    <h4 class="margin-top-30 margin-left-35 font-size-16"><strong>12.2 Post-Launch - Services suspension </strong></h4>
                    <p class="margin-left-35 margin-top-15">VinCam-RBM team may suspend RBM services on Launched Agents that violate RBM policies. This means that the Agents can no longer use RBM services until the problem is fixed and passed a policy review.</p>
                    <h4 class="margin-top-30 margin-left-35 font-size-16"><strong>12.3 Account suspension</strong></h4>
                    <p class="margin-left-35 margin-top-15">We may suspend your account if you have several violations or a serious violation. If this happens, all Agents from your account will be disabled. Any related accounts, including your new account, may be automatically suspended.

                    <p class="margin-top-15 padding-left-20">The Agent should be submitted for verification and launch by the Developer upon successful completion of the testing of the Agent. As part of verification, we check the following:</p>
